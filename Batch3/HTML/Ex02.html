                            The city's history dates back to around 890 AD, in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur,
                            Bangalore. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of
                            Bengaluru). It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears the earliest reference to the
                            name 'Bengaluru'. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort
                            considered to be the foundation of modern Bengaluru and its oldest areas, or petes, which exist to the present day.
                            After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704),
                            the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees. When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of
                            Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. It was captured by the British East India Company after
                            victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of
                            Mysore. The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of
                            Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment
                            to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following
                            India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the new Indian
                            state of Karnataka was formed in 1956.
